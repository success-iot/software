	Attack-Defense Exploration Tool
	-------------------------------

1. Description

This directory provides the implementation of the attack-defense
exploration method published in the paper:

  Braham Lotfi Mediouni, Ayoub Nouri, Marius Bozga,
  Axel Legay, Saddek Bensalem:
  Mitigating Security Risks Through Attack Strategies Exploration.
  Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification
  and Validation - 8th International Symposium, ISoLA 2018
  Proceedings Part II, LNCS 11245:392-413

2. Compilation Instructions

- Java 11 is required to compile sources

- Download ANTLR v4 (version antlr-4.7-complete.jar)
from https://www.antlr.org/download/index.html.
Place the jar file into the attack-defense/lib directory.

- Use ant to compile and run the application as follows

    $ ant compile
    $ ant jar


3. Benchmarks

Several benchmarks are included in the examples directory.
Every benchmark can be run by calling

   $ bin/adt.sh <behnchmark>.adt

where <benchmark> can be actually one of orga, bgp, scada or im.
On completion, the attack tree annotated with the most
impactful defender will be exported in <benchmark>.dot.

Optional, the tool can be invoked from the ant script

   $ ant run -Dadtfile=examples/<benchmark>.adt
